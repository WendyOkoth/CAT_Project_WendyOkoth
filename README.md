# CAT_Project_WendyOkoth
This is a cat project that shows my progress in the unit internet technologies and the web which I am taught by my lecturer Mr.Stanley Nguga in KCA University.
So far i have attached two codes made in the app visual studio code which showcase my project,porfolio.html and FG entreprise.html.
The first project code FG Entreprise.html contains codes which showcase the bronchure about my company.
The second project code porfolio.html contains codes about my porfolio which will be used to enable me to apply and get jobs from other software development companies.
